# write a python program to print the are using the formula a = pi r^2

# Logic Building formula

#Step 1
#Figure out input and output

# value of r -> float
#pi = 3.14
# power = pow or **
# o/p - float, area, print area

#step 2
#rough logic = area = pi * pow(r,2)

#step 3

radius = float(input("please enter the radius: "))
print (radius)5

area = 3.14 * (radius ** 2)
print("area of the circle is " , area)
print(f"area of the circle is -> {area}" )
